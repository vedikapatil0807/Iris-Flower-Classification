Datasets
The project utilizes the well-known Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with 50 samples for each of the three species. The dataset includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Key Features:
Data Exploration and Visualization: Understand the structure and relationships between different features in the Iris dataset through visualizations like pair plots and summary statistics.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing the features to ensure optimal model performance.
Model Training and Evaluation: Train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to classify the Iris species. Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Optimization: Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to enhance the model's accuracy and performance.
